For many businesses, the sales and deployment of resources depend on the weather conditions.
SkyGraph is a web-based application that analyzes the past business data from the clients and
eventually provides them with visual representation of the data, predicted sales and the amount
of resources to be deployed for the running of the businesses depending on the expected weather
conditions.

P.S: The concept was devised by the CS 440 fall 2014 Students and we only implemented a part of the concept.
